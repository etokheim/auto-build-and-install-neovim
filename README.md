# Auto Install Neovim for Pi
This script automatically builds, installs and configures Neovim. It's made for Raspberry Pis, for which there isn't prebuilt images available, but should run just fine for most Linux distributions.

What it does:
 1. Updates repositories 
 2. Installs the required tools for building Neovim
 3. Downloads and compiles the latest stable version of Neovim
 4. Installs Neovim
 5. Installs vim-plug (a plugin manager for vim/neovim)
 6. Configures Neovim (Configuration files: https://github.com/etokheim/nvim-config.git)
