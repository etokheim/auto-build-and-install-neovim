 2. Installs the required tools for building Neovim
 3. Downloads and compiles the latest stable version of Neovim
 4. Installs Neovim (Release version)
 5. Installs vim-plug (a plugin manager for vim/neovim)
 6. Configures Neovim (Configuration file: https://github.com/etokheim/nvim-config.git)

## How to run
 1. Clone this repository
 2. Run the install.sh:
